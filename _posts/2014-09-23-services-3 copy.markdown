Spend the morning at your leisure. This is a good time to explore some of Cusco’s less-visited attractions including the famous San Pedro Market, the bohemian neighborhood of San Blas, or one of Cusco’s many fine museums, such as the Museum of Pre-Columbian Art, the Casa Concha (“Machu-Picchu Museum”), or the Choco Museum, where you can make your own chocolate from scratch (chocolate is indigenous to the New World). <br>
In the afternoon, an expert guide will take you to some of the world’s best archeological sites in and around the city, including the Cusco Cathedral in the Plaza de Armas and the fabulous Temple of the Sun or Qoricancha, which was the heart of the Inca Empire.  You will also visit the spectacular ruins of the Sacsayhuaman fortress/temple overlooking the city, as well as the ruins of Q'enko, Puka Pukara, and Tambomachay nearby.
<br> In the late afternoon, you'll return to your Cusco hotel. Spend the evening at your leisure enjoying the local cuisine, music, and the splendor of Cusco at night, the surrounding hills twinkling with lights and the sky overhead littered with stars.
